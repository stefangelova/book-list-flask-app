# Reading list web-application 

The purpose of this project was to create a CRUD web-application, with a relational database and deployed with Jenskins.

## Solution

For this project I have created a web application;Reading List, which allows users to register and view a large selection of books from which they can select and add to a personal reading list. The application is CRUD functional as it also allows users to update and delete their profiles. The inspiration behind the project is a popular book related website called Goodreads where users are able to register, create personal reading lists, are provided with recommendations and reviews of books from other users, are able to review the books themselves. In addition the users are provided with suggestions of where to buy the books they would like to read, such as Amazon.
