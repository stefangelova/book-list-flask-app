# Reading list web-application 

The purpose of this project was to create a CRUD web-application, with a relational database and deployed with Jenskins.


## Solution

For this project I have created a web application; Reading List, which allows users to register and view a large selection of books from which they can select and add to a personal reading list. The application is CRUD functional as it also allows users to update and delete their profiles. The inspiration behind the project is a popular book related website called Goodreads where users are able to register, create personal reading lists, are provided with recommendations and reviews of books from other users, are able to review the books themselves. In addition, the users are provided with suggestions of where to buy the books they would like to read, such as Amazon.

## Issues Encountered

An unforeseen amount of issues was encountered during the development of the application such as the amount of trial and error which occurred. In addition, the lack of close familiarity with the technologies greatly impacted the timely and efficient development of certain features. The time and structure that was planned initially contrasted almost completely with the execution, however the robust planning did help with minimise the impact and maintain a certain structure. An unfortunate issue I encountered was while conducting the testing, which proved to be an unexpectedly arduous task, which unfortunately could not successfully complete leaving the coverage at 40%. Another issue I encountered was the displaying of data, which impacted both, displaying the reading list of each user as well as the displaying of the average rating of each book.

## Future Refactoring 

There are many functionalities that I would like to incorporate into my application in the future. To begin with I would like to complete the functions which I could not fulfil in the two sprints I conducted; such as full coverage testing, rating display on the home page, as well as display of the reading lists of the users, in their accounts. In addition I would like to create a search function which would allow users to search the database and add books to their reading lists. Another good idea would be to have a book reviewing functionality which would allow users to share reviews of the books they have read as well as read reviews of other users. The users should also be able to upload profile photos. I would also like to incorporate ratings for the books which would be submitted by the users, consequently calculating the average book rating as rated by the users of the website as well as the international average rating. A good feature to have would be to provide links to websites or bookstores which sell the books that the particular user is interested in reading. What is more I would like to incorporate a suggestion function so that users are able to receive suggestions which cater to their expressed interest in specific genres.
